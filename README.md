# COVID-19 & Economic Tracker
The **COVID-19 & Economic Tracker** was created to help people gain an understanding of the impact COVID-19 on Canada's economy. Our application does this by providing users with data visualizations that allow for direct comparisons between COVID-19 cases and economic data.

The economic data we provide includes data on CERB payments, employment numbers, and average weekly earnings in Canada. We allow the user to select these types of data for specific provinces and industries where applicable. Additionally, users can select the type of chart that they want to see this data represented in.
 
This allows the user to make queries on various types of data, for either the same or different locations, in order to visually see correlations or differences between the selected data.
